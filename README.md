# INET4031 - Module 6 - Working with Remote Systems

## Instructions, files, code for Lab 6.

What if you aren't nearby the computer you need to work on?

Up until this point, our Lab activities have been accomplished by doing them on our laptops.

In this activity we explore the concept of "servers."  Which typically aren't located where we are.

We have to connect to them remotely

This Lab explores that concept.
